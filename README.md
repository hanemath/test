For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](https://webpack.js.org/).

Note : for some reason, the .gitignore file cant ignore folders (node_modules & dist) and sometimes lead to errors on running the projects. We recommend to delete the folders manually before you run npm install so that you can get a fresh installed dependencies packages. Hopefully this note could reach you to better understand this project. Thank you.
